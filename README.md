### Code Explanation

The code is divided into several sections:

1. Input parameters: Here, you can define the input parameters for the robot, such as the frequency of opening deals, success rate of profitable trades, and maximum allowed drawdown.

2. Expert initialization function: This function is called when the expert advisor is initialized. You can add any initialization code here.

3. Expert deinitialization function: This function is called when the expert advisor is deinitialized. You can add any deinitialization code here.

4. Expert start function: This is the main function where the trading logic is implemented. It starts by checking if the expert advisor is being optimized. If it is, independent optimization is performed. Then, the code proceeds to open deals at a high frequency based on the specified success rate. It also checks for drawdown and closes deals if necessary.

5. Helper functions: These functions are used to check if a trade is profitable, open a new deal, check drawdown, and close all open deals. You can add custom code to these functions as per your requirements.
